This year I’ve been lucky enough to work on a new game called Secret Hitler, which is now about halfway through its Kickstarter campaign to raise $54,000 for a first printing.

This is the fourth tabletop game I’ve funded on Kickstarter (I am also a co-creator of Cards Against Humanity, Werewolf, and Slap .45), and through those projects, I’ve learned so much about quickly prototyping games and bringing them to market.

In this blog post, I want to talk about the process of designing and prototyping Secret Hitler, and what I learned from the mistakes and blunders in my earlier projects.
