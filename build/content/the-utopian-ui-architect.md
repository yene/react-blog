<h2 class="center">The Utopian UI Architect</h2>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> An ex-Apple interface designer’s 40-year plan to redesign not just the way we use computers, but the way we think with them</h4>


<div class="pullquote">When Bret Victor came in for his first day of work as a [“Human Interface Inventor” at Apple](http://worrydream.com/#!/Apple), he found an iPad sitting on his desk. It was August of 2007. The original iPhone was only a couple months old. iPods still generated a third of the company’s revenue. The App Store didn’t exist.</div>

“I said, ‘What is this?’ and they said, ‘We don’t know yet,’” Victor recalls. “It was an early prototype of the hardware. Maybe twenty other people in the world knew about it. Nobody had answers. My job was to try to figure it out.”

### Which is Worse: A Sunburn or a Beheading?

When fighting to be heard above a crowd, most people will simply try to shout louder than everyone else. That seems to be the strategy of choice for Rand Paul and especially Mike Huckabee, whose emails have grown more histrionic over the past month. Here’s a quick sample of some of my favorites:

Victor spent the next two months making “an app every week, explor[ing] new UI ideas” as part of a three-person “internal R&D prototyping group” that Apple had assembled. Soon, Victor says, the iPad became “a real project” and his group was reassigned to tinker with other experimental hardware. “Everyone [at Apple] was focused on the next product release, what needed to happen six months from now,” he says. “We were the ones looking at what could happen five or ten years from now.”

* “I refuse to let Obama destroy our country! I refuse to walk my grandchildren through the **charred remains of a once great America! I** refuse to surrender!” — Mike Huckabee
* “…I’m counting on your support to help me bust through the media blackout. Both the media and the political establishment know I’m the **Washington Machine’s worst nightmare.**” — Rand Paul
* “**Christians are under attack** like never before by Islamist radicals abroad and liberal, secular elites at home. President Obama is in bed with the radical liberals who will stop at NOTHING!” — Mike Huckabee
* “Incredibly, Democrats believe climate change is a greater threat than Islamic extremism and that **A SUNBURN, is worse than a BEHEADING.**” — Mike Huckabee

Seven years later, in 2014, Bret Victor is still looking at “what could happen” to human-computer interaction in the near future. He’s still part of a close-knit internal prototyping lab (the Communications Design Group) bankrolled by a huge tech corporation (SAP). But instead of designing interfaces and exploring use cases for tomorrow’s glass-screened gadgets, Victor’s “forty-years-out vision” concerns nothing less than redesigning computing itself — not as a product or service, but “as a medium of thought.”
