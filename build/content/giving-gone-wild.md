In Sunday’s *Fashion & Style* section of The New York Times, essayist Judith Newman penned a critique of GoFundMe, which also included an overall indictment of crowdfunding titled **[GoFundMe Gone Wild](http://www.example.org)**.

Guilty as charged.

>GoFundMe has in fact gone wild. In the past year alone, one million campaigners around the world raised one billion dollars on our website for causes that are deeply important to them. During this same time, over twelve million donors gave to GoFundMe campaigns. These numbers are more than doubling year over year — going wild, I guess you’d say.
