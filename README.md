# React blog something

Small blog in react that uses HTTP directory listing as index, no backend needed.


## Technology
* React.js
* Webpack
* ES2015


## Folders & Files
* /app contains the react code
* /build contains the generated version ready for deploy
* /app/index.jsx is our webpack starting point

## external dependencies
* React.js is included from CDN, with local fallback

## Questions & Goals
* How to add CSS to ES2015 modules, is there a nice way with webpack.
* Learn a few things that then can be ported to blog software hugo.

## Todo
- [ ] make package private so it does not get pushed accidentally
